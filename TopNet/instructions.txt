# Let's create a singularity docker (.SIF) by executing the following line. (Modify filename later)
singularity pull docker://ubuntu
# Once done, all libraries must be installed. To pursue that, we shall convert .SIF to SANDBOX, open it, and reconvert to SIF again, depicted in the following commands:
sudo singularity build --sandbox SANDBOX  SIF_FILE (SIF--> SANDBOX)
sudo singularity shell --writable SANDBOX/ (Open and write in SANDBOX (ex. install packages) )
sudo singularity build SIF_FILE SANDBOX (SANDBOX-->SIF)

That's all folks!
